librangetree is a C++ template, implementing a 2d range tree for both
counting and reporting queries.

Intro
-----

So what's it and why would I need it?

It's a solution for a specific type of searches - those done on relatively
static data, in two dimensions.

.For example:
- Give me the names of all people between the ages 35-56 earning 20-50k
- How many cities exist between coordinates 56,67 and 77,89


What it looks like
------------------
.In-memory layout

In this example, we added three points to the tree:
(1, 0), (10, 0), and (100, 0).

As can be seen, any kind of range search can be efficiently answered from
this tree.

Limits
------

.Limits
- Once created, it is read-only
- The maximum dataset it can hold is 2^32 (4 billion points).

TIP: If you need more, consider splitting your data at a higher
level.

- Creation is not thread-safe - searches are
